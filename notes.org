* note 1
  spr-sola-addons option "linksfromyear" is tested with:
	1. texlive/2008 - natbib 8.1,   hyperref v6.78f
	2. texlive/2009 - natbib 8.31,  hyperref v6.79a
	3. texlive/2010 - natbib 8.31a, hyperref v6.81g
     When hyperref is loaded make a hyperlink only from year component 
     of the cite command. It solves the problem of overfull boxes when dvips driver is used.
     It might not work with an older natbib packages.
     Citation style should be an author-year, and the hyperref should be loaded somewhere in preamble.
     Use "nolinksfromyear" if you want to disable it.

* note 2
  spr-sola-addons loads a natbib package. Use "nonatbib" option if you don't want to load it.

* note 3
  Option "showbiblabels" outputs \bibitem label on every bibitem end (command \endbibitem). 
  This option should be used  just for compatibility while citing a document.
